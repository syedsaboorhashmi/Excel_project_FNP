## Data Preparation and Modeling

This project integrates data from three key datasets: `orders.csv`, `customers.csv`, and `products.csv`.

### Power Query Transformations

- Data cleaning: Removed nulls, corrected formats for dates and numeric columns.
- Merging tables:
  - `orders` was merged with `customers` using `CustomerID`.
  - `orders` was merged with `products` using `ProductID`.
- Date extraction:
  - Extracted `Month`, `Year`, and `Hour` from `Order Date` and `Delivery Date`.
  - Created `Order to Delivery Days` column using DAX:
    ```dax
    Order to Delivery Time = DATEDIFF('Orders'[Order Date], 'Orders'[Delivery Date], DAY)
    ```

### Custom Columns and Measures

- **Order Month**:
    ```dax
    Order Month = FORMAT('Orders'[Order Date], "MMMM")
    ```

- **Order Hour**:
    ```dax
    Order Hour = HOUR('Orders'[Order Date])
    ```

- **Total Revenue**:
    ```dax
    Total Revenue = SUM('Orders'[TotalAmount])
    ```

- **Average Customer Spend**:
    ```dax
    Avg Customer Spend = AVERAGEX(VALUES('Customers'[CustomerID]), [Total Revenue per Customer])
    ```

- **Total Orders**:
    ```dax
    Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT('Orders'[OrderID])
    ```

- **Revenue Rank (for Top Products)**:
    ```dax
    Revenue Rank = RANKX(ALL('Products'[ProductName]), [Total Revenue], , DESC)
    ```
